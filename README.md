Normal (Gaussian) Distribution in Data Analysis
Z-Score & Outlier Removal

This project demonstrates the practical application of Normal (Gaussian) Distribution concepts in Data Science and Machine Learning, with a focus on outlier detection and removal.

Many real-world datasets approximately follow a bell-shaped (normal) distribution. In this project, a dataset containing gender and height is analyzed to identify and remove unusual or extreme values (outliers) using Z-Score and Standard Deviation methods.

Outliers are detected based on the statistical rule that any data point lying beyond ±3 standard deviations (±3σ) from the mean is considered an outlier. The project includes:

Calculation of mean and standard deviation

Z-score–based outlier detection

Removal of extreme values

Visualization using histograms before and after outlier removal

This project highlights how statistical techniques improve data quality and prepare datasets for reliable machine learning modeling and analysis.
